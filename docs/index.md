intro: 
  - excerpt: "Legolas, short for **L**arge **E**igensystem **G**enerator for **O**ne-dimensional p**LAS**mas, is a novel
              finite element code tailored to MHD spectroscopy of 1D Cartesian/cylindrical 
              equilibria with flow that balance pressure gradients, enriched with various non-adiabatic effects."

    excerpt: Legolas can do a multitude of things, ranging from full spectrum calculations to eigenfunctions 
             of specific modes, to full-on parametric studies of various equilibrium configurations in different
             geometries. Take a look at the examples to see what the code is capable of.

    excerpt: We've written a method paper, published in the Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series,
             showcasing Legolas to the scientific community. If you use Legolas for a publication,
             we kindly ask you to cite it.
